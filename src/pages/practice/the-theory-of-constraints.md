  Eliyahu Goldratt first described the Theory Of Constraints (ToC) in his 1984
  book, "The Goal", which focussed on manufacturing and was a key catalyst for
  the revolution in the performance of manufacturing in subsequent years.


  The Theory of Constraints shows us that in any process, there must be a single bottleneck that limits the total throughput of the process: in the same way that a chain has a weakest link, a process has a single slowest component.
whyDo: >-
  Whilst it may be easy to improve some part of the process, if that component
  isn't the bottleneck, it will either have zero effect on the throughput
  because the bottleneck is upstream, or it will actually cause more pain in the
  system by adding pressure to the bottleneck, if the bottleneck is downstream. 


  This is why “Any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion.” 


  In some systems, the bottleneck is clear to see, such as a narrow junction on a busy street, or a bend in a garden hose. 


  In some systems, especially those that don't have material, or "inventory" flowing through them, the constraint can be more difficult to see. This includes many business or technology processes such as software and product development. 


  Using the ToC to identify bottlenecks (constraints) in a process enables teams and organisations to decide where to focus optimisation work. When the optimisation, elevation, or removal of the constraint is complete, the process begins again to find the next constraint (because there is always the next one).

  TBC


  Identify the constraint - maybe by looking at where WIP is piling up.




  Exploit the constraint (make the most of it and find out its limits)


  Then:


  Optimisation - make the constraint more efficient (maybe by automation?)


  Elevation - throw more resource at the constraint (maybe add more CPU, or people, or things)


  Removal - maybe you don't need it - get rid of it.


  Then start again. This may have identified where the next constraint is. Or maybe it's still the same one?
