whatIs: >-
  Eliyahu Goldratt first described the Theory Of Constraints in his 1984 book,
  "The Goal", which focussed on manufacturing and was a key catalyst for the
  revolution in the performance of manufacturing in subsequent years.


  The theory of constraints shows us that in any process, there must be a single bottleneck that limits the throughput of the process: in the same way that a chain has a weakest link, a process has a single slowest component.
whyDo: >-
  Whilst it may be easy to improve some part of the process, if that component
  isn't the bottleneck, it will either have zero effect on the throughput
  because the bottleneck is upstream, or it will actually cause more pain in the
  system by adding pressure to the bottleneck, if the bottleneck is downstream. 


  In some systems, the bottleneck is clear to see, such as a narrow junction on a busy street, or a bend in a garden hose. In some systems, especially those that don't have material, or "inventory" flowing through them, thew constraint can be more difficult to see.
