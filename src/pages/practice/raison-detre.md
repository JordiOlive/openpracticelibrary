whatIs: As teams form or embark upon new directions it is important that they
  understand their reason for coming together, their team's reason for
  being.  This exercise helps to define a manifesto for the team so that
  everyone on the team agrees upon and has crystal clarity on their purpose
  moving forward as well as being a guide-post reminder as to that purpose
  during times of pressure or as that clarity becomes muffled.
whyDo: We perform this practice to ensure that all members of the team are clear
  on their purpose and that they are rowing in rhythm and in the same direction.
